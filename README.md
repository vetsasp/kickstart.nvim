# kickstart.nvim

#### kickstart.nvim clone

> My Neovim config, forked from kickstart.nvim. I plan on very slowly building this out until it has all the tooling necessary to replace my LazyVim distro, which I am currently running alongside this one. The goal is for it to be very simple; it should contain all the features I expect, and nothing more. 


```sh
git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```
